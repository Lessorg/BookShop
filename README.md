# üñ•Ô∏èüê≥ How to Run the Bookshop Application Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the Bookshop application on your local machine. With its containerized architecture using Docker, deployment and management are streamlined.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed on your system before proceeding:

>Java (JDK 17 or higher): Download from Oracle or OpenJDK.
Docker & Docker Compose: Install Docker Desktop.
Maven (3.8+ required): Install from Apache Maven.
Git: Download from Git's official website.
MySQL (v15): Necessary if you want to set up the database locally outside of Docker.
Postman (Optional): For API testing, download Postman.

## üèÉSteps to Set Up and Run
Clone the Repository
1. git clone https://github.com/Lessorg/BookShop
2. cd jv-book-shop  
3. Configure Environment Variables
4. Copy the provided .env.example file to .env and edit it with your custom configurations:

Update the .env file with your desired values (e.g., database connection details, port configurations).
```sh
cp .env.example .env  
```
Build the application using Maven:
```sh
mvn clean install  
Run the Application with Docker Compose
```
Start the application along with its dependencies (like the database):
```sh
docker-compose up -d  
```
Access the Application
To shut down the application and its containers:
```sh
docker-compose down  
```
API Documentation: Access Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.
Test the APIs using Postman or any HTTP client tool.

## üìú Troubleshooting
- Docker Issues: Ensure Docker Desktop is running. Restart Docker if any containers fail to start.
- Port Conflicts: Check if the ports specified in the .env file (e.g., 8080 for the app, 3306 for MySQL) are available. Modify them in .env if necessary.
- Database Configuration: Verify MySQL credentials in the .env file match those in docker-compose.yml.
- Enjoy your journey with the Bookshop application! üìö
